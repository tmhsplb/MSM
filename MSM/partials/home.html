    Welcome to the OPID Check Handling Site.
</p>
 
<p>
This website serves as a bridge between two systems, Quickbooks and Apricot, which have no knowledge
of each other but must cooperate in managing services provided to clients of Operation ID. Quickbooks is the accounting
package used by Operation ID to issue checks for services provided to its clients. Apricot is the database management 
package used by Operation ID to track the clients it serves.
</p>
<p>
On the day a service is provided to an Operation ID client, Quickbooks is used to issue a check to cover the cost of the service 
and the check number of the issued check is recorded in a data record associated with the client. On a later day the disposition
of the issued check either becomes known to Quickbooks through the issuing bank or the check is manually voided in Quickbooks
by Operation ID personnel. In either case, Apricot must be made aware of the checks disposition in order to have a complete
accounting of the outcome of a service provided to a client.
</p>
<p>
This website is designed as a tool to make Apricot aware of the disposition of checks issued by Quickbooks. A check whose
disposition becomes known to Apricot is said to be <i>resolved</i>. A check whose disposition is not yet known is said to be
<i>in research</i>. The website manages a database table of checks that are in research, visible under the Research
tab in the main menu. New checks are entered into the Research table by using the Merge tab to merge in a research file. There
are two type of research files: <i>interview research</i> files and <i>modification research</i> files. An interview research
file is generated by running the Interview Research report in Apricot and a modifications research file is generated by running the
Modifications Research report. Each report is filtered by a start date and an end date and lists the checks issued to each client 
between these dates together with their known or unknown disposition. When the output file of one of these reports is merged into
the Research table, only those checks whose disposition is not known are added
</p>
<p>
A check remains in the Research table until its disposition becomes known.  
The disposition of a check appears in one of two Quickbooks reports. The first report lists checks that have been cashed by a 
client and hence cleared by the bank or have been deliberately voided by the bank. The second report lists checks that have been 
voided by Operation ID personnel.
</p>
<p>
A check appearing in one of these two reports is compared by check number to a check
in the Research table. If a matching check is found, it is removed from the Research table and added together with
its known disposition (either cleared or voided) to a report called an <i>importme</i> report which must be imported into Apricot.
An importme report consists of resolved checks and must be downloaded from the Resolved tab after a merge operation
has been performed. A downloaded importme report will contain a timestamp in its file name for the purpose of record
keeping.  The Resolved tab also display a table of checks that have been resolved by merging during this
session. This table may be downloaded as an Excel file for additional record keeping purposes. The file name of this
Excel file will also contain a timestamp in its name. 
</p>
<p>
The workflow that has been described implies that the purpose of the website is to move checks from the state of being
in research to the state of being resolved. Checks that are resolved can be imported into Apricot to give Apricot
a complete accounting of services rendered to a client.
